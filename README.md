My friend and I started doing this project in our spare times during our internship. By project I meant a game
which is mainly played in the site called 4chan. 4chan is basically a message board in which you can post images,text etc.
I am not planing to explain how game is played in here. But you can look at the image below which is self-explanatory.

#This game is peer-to-peer!
webRTC: The connection established between peers instead of servers. So server is used only for downloading static 
content.Once you create a game or join a game, you are directly connected to the peers instead of server. I think this is
awesome! Ä±f you want to learn how this works go [here](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/).Thanks to Muaz Khan's datachannel.js library.
#Current State
This game is still in development! Since we haven't implemented a game logic yet, you won't be able to play this game. But
you can create rooms or join rooms and chat with other people. I don't know why would you do that but hey, I am here to 
inform you!
